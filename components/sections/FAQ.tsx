  {
    q: "How does Tabby split the bill?",
    a: "One person scans the receipt. Everyone on the tab claims the items they ordered. Shared plates can be split evenly or by custom amounts among whoever claims them. Each person selects a tip, reviews their total, and pays their share. All funds are held in escrow until everyone has paid. Once the full amount is collected, a one-time virtual card appears on the tab initiator's phone. They tap it to the POS terminal and pay the restaurant in one clean transaction. No one fronts the bill. No chasing payments after the meal. Done before the server comes back.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do all my friends need the app?",
    a: "No. While having the app makes the experience faster, anyone can join a tab through a URL link. The tab creator shares the link, and participants can claim their items and pay their share without downloading anything. For regular users, the app makes starting and joining tabs instant.",
  },
  {
    q: "What payment methods are supported?",
    a: "Debit cards, credit cards, and bank accounts. Cryptocurrency payments are coming in a future version. You add a payment method once and it's saved for future tabs.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is my payment info secure?",
    a: "Yes. Payment processing is handled through our banking infrastructure partner. We never store your card number or bank details on our servers. All transactions are encrypted and processed through PCI-compliant systems. Funds are held in secure escrow until the tab is complete. Your payment information is as secure as any major banking app.",
  },
  {
    q: "How much does Tabby cost?",
    a: "Tabby is free to join — you only pay a small settlement fee when you close a tab, and whoever started it covers that one charge. Your friends pay their share and nothing extra. Bank transfers are free; no per-person fees, no hidden costs. Join the waitlist for early access when we launch.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is Tabby available outside the US?",
    a: "Not yet. We're launching in the United States first so we can nail the experience with one banking infrastructure. International rollout is planned for later — join the waitlist and we'll let you know the moment Tabby lands in your country.",
